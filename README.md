## General Knowledge
  ### What is a host :
  refers to any device or computer that is connected to a network and has a unique identity within that network. These devices can include computers, servers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, or any other device that can connect to a network, cloud resources are also considered a host, The same goes for internet of Things devices.
  hosts are divided into two parts **Clients** and **Servers** and the clients are the ones responsible for initiating data while the servers respond that just for a duration of time because a lot of devices can play both sides based on the situation

  ### Ip address
  An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses serve two primary functions in networking:

* Device Identification: IP addresses are like digital addresses for devices on a network. Just as your home has a unique postal address to receive mail, each device on a network is assigned a unique IP address to send and receive data. This address helps identify the device and distinguish it from others on the same network. It typically looks like a sequence of numbers and periods, such as "192.168.1.1."

* Routing Data: IP addresses play a crucial role in routing data across networks. When you send data from your device to another device on the Internet, routers use the destination IP address to determine the path the data should take to reach its destination. Think of IP addresses as postal codes that guide data packets through the network to the correct recipient.

The ip addresses come in two main versions IPv4 and IPv6 which were introduced Due to the rapid growth of the Internet,

So for the data passing the internet, there is a set of info latched into it containing the IP address of the sender and the receiver, the IP address helps us route the way for a packet.

so every department has its own network.

  ### Network :
  so to achieve the minimum requirement for a network is to connect at least two hosts together,
  After connecting the two hosts they're finally ready to talk to each other, now A network in a nutshell is a logical grouping of hosts that require similar connectivity where networks can contain other networks(Sub-Networks) and networks connect to other networks using the internet,
  ### Repeater :
  So the repeater only got introduced because of the decay of signals between hosts so the repeater does what its name signifies it repeats signals (regenerates signals) until it reaches the destination

  ### Hub :
  A hub is a basic networking device that operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. Its primary function is to connect multiple network devices together within the same local area network (LAN) and facilitate the transmission of data packets between them. However, it's important to note that hubs are not intelligent devices and lack the sophistication of more advanced networking equipment like switches and routers.
  ### Bridge :
  Now, let's delve into bridges. Bridges are more intelligent networking devices that operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. Unlike hubs, bridges make decisions based on MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and can filter and forward data selectively. They play a crucial role in segmenting and optimizing network traffic within LANs. Understanding bridges is essential for building efficient and well-organized local networks.

By transitioning from hubs to bridges, you'll gain insights into how networking devices can be smarter and more selective in handling data, paving the way for further discussions on switches, routers, and more advanced networking concepts in subsequent chapters.
